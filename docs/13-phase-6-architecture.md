# Phase 6: Architecture Patterns Implementation

## Overview
This phase focuses on implementing the core architecture patterns (Clean Architecture + MVI).

## Goals
- Implement Clean Architecture layers
- Set up MVI pattern
- Create ViewModel base classes
- Implement state management
- Set up navigation

## Deliverables
- [ ] Clean Architecture layers implemented
- [ ] MVI pattern setup
- [ ] ViewModel base classes
- [ ] State management system
- [ ] Navigation setup

## Phase-Specific Checklist Items
- [ ] **MVI Implementation**: State, Intent, Event interfaces
- [ ] **Unidirectional Data Flow**: State flows down, actions flow up
- [ ] **UI Architecture**: No business logic in UI
- [ ] **State Management**: ViewModels manage UI state
- [ ] **Event Handling**: Use ObserveAsEvents for one-time events
- [ ] **Navigation**: Proper navigation patterns
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Business logic tested
- [ ] **Repository Logic**: Data layer logic tested

## Key Patterns
- Clean Architecture implementation
- MVI pattern setup
- ViewModel base classes
- State management
- Navigation architecture

## Success Criteria
- Architecture patterns fully implemented
- MVI pattern working
- State management complete
- Phase 7 ready to begin
